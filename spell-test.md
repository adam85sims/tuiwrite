# Spell Check Test

This is a test of the spellchecker functionality. Let's add some mispelled words to see if they get highlighted in red.

Here are some intentional errors:
- recieve (should be receive)
- occured (should be occurred)
- seperate (should be separate)
- definately (should be definitely)
- thier (should be their)

And some correct words:
- hello
- world
- testing
- functionality
- working

The spell checker should highlight the incorrect words with a red background using the Catppuccin Mocha Red color.
